		  <strong>Disadvantages of using business loans</strong>
		</h2>
		<div class="text-panel__rich-text w-richtext">
		  <p>
		    While business loans offer many benefits, there are some
		    downsides to consider:
		  </p>
		  <ul role="list">
		    <li>
		      <strong>Repayment obligations</strong>: Loans must be
		      repaid on schedule – missing payments could damage your
		      business credit rating.
		    </li>
		    <li>
		      <strong>Interest costs</strong>: Loans involve interest
		      payments, potentially increasing your overall costs,
		      especially with higher interest rates or longer terms.
		    </li>
		    <li>
		      <strong>Impact on cash flow</strong>: Regular repayments
		      could put pressure on your cash flow if not properly
		      managed.
		    </li>
		    <li>
		      <strong>Early repayment fees: </strong>With some lenders
		      you may have to pay a fee if you pay back your loan early.
		      Although if you take out an Contigo business loan, we will
		      never change you an early repayment fee.
		    </li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>
		    Only you can decide if a business loan is right for you –
		    make sure you take the time to compare providers and choose
		    one that fits with your needs, whether that means
		    flexibility, borrowing amounts or interest rates.&nbsp;

		  <strong>Where to get a business loan</strong>
		</h2>
		<div class="text-panel__rich-text w-richtext">
		  <p>
		    There are two distinct groups of business loan providers:
		    high street banks and alternative lenders. They provide
		    slightly different products and user experiences, so it’s
		    important to select a lender whose offering best matches
		    your specific business needs.
		  </p>
		  <h3>High Street Banks</h3>
		  <p>
		    Traditional banks remain a common source for small business
		    loans. However when applying for bank loans, small
		    businesses are often faced with a slow &amp; bureaucratic
		    application process, rigid lending criteria and inflexible
		    loan terms. This is why many small businesses are turning to
		    alternative lenders, such as Contigo. <br />
		  </p>
		  <h3><strong>Alternative Lenders</strong></h3>
		  <p>
		    Alternative (or online) lenders offer a faster, more
		    customer-centric experience than high street banks. Although
		    alternative lenders may charge higher interest rates than
		    high street banks, they can still be a great choice for
		    short-term funding. Alternative lenders are often more
		    flexible than high street banks – for example, Contigo lets
		    you repay your loan early with no extra fees, helping you
		    save on interest over the long term.&nbsp;
		  </p>

			    Secured business loans are protected by collateral,
			    which is an asset that the lender can seize if you
			    fail to repay the loan. Secured loans usually offer
			    lower interest rates and higher loan amounts. On the
			    other hand, unsecured business loans don't require
			    collateral, but the lender may request a personal
			    guarantee.

			  A

			    Getting a small business loan with a poor credit
			    history can be challenging, but it's not impossible.
			    Here are some tips to help you secure a loan:
			</p>
			<ul role="list">
			  <li class="list-item-2">
			      <strong>Check your credit score: </strong>Before
			      applying, check your credit score and identify areas
			      for improvement
			  </li>
			  <li class="list-item-2">
			      <strong>Improve your business finances: </strong
			      >Show lenders that your business is profitable and
			      has a solid financial foundation
			  </li>
			  <li class="list-item-2">
			      <strong>Explore alternative lenders: </strong
			      >Consider lenders that have more flexible
			    requirements and are more willing to work with
			      businesses with poor credit
			  </li>
			  <li class="list-item-2">
			    <strong>Provide collateral: </strong>If you have
			    assets that can be used as collateral, this can
			      increase your chances of getting approved
			  </li>
			  <li class="list-item-2">
			      <strong>Consider a co-signer: </strong>If you can
			      find someone with a strong credit score to co-sign
			      the loan, lenders may be more willing to approve
			      your application. However, this can be risky as the
			    co-signer is equally responsible for repaying the
			    loan.
			  </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			    Keep in mind that getting a loan with poor credit can
			    come with higher interest rates. It's essential to
			    weigh your options carefully to avoid further
			    financial strain.
